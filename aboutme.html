                        I am Ranjith Selvan. Most people call me RJ for convenience. I am a programmer. I started my programming adventure in 7th grade and have been doing it ever since. I started out using GameMaker to make simple games, and now have pursued the interest all they way to the completion of a Degree in Computer Science Dec of 2015. Along the way I've learned, C, C++, C#, Java, Lua, Python, JavaScript, and HTML and CSS(if you want to count the last two as programming). I've also learned skills and methods for testing using unit testing provided by the languages themselves and other frameworks, like Selenium and Robot. I've also had projects, that involved simulating UNIX like File Systems, and UNIX like Operating Systems. My favorite project in school was by far OpenGL and Glut. (You can look at some of these projects and others on my projects page)

                        I am interested in any kind of software development in order to learn how corporate and business level development works, and gain the skills that the environments offer. As an entry level prospect I am excited to keep learning.
