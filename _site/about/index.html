            <div class="post-content">
My name is Ranjith Selvan. I was born in India in 1992 and moved to the US with my parents when I was 7. I started programing when I was 12 using Gamemaker as my application of choice. I took my first offical programming class in the summer of my 9th grade year, 2009: Introduction to Java. With that introduction I was more than interested, I was hooked.

<br/><br/>
I build my first offical Java project the next year for my Chemistry class, "Mole Jeopardy. It was crude, showed no design, and very basic. All I had to work with at that time was my textbook, Java in Quick Easy Steps, the online Java API documentation, and my understanding of that information and programming.

<br/><br/>
Thankfully I have learned more about programming, software design, and testing to now be able to create my own websites, complex problems, and quick quality of life improvements. I've created projects like Sudoku solvers, and a miriad of games, most of which never left basic prototyping because they were not fun, websites to count time, and scripts to crawl through the minecraft name servers to find the avaliblity of names. I have created scripts to give me prime numbers, and to take a copied tabled of Keyboard key codes, and create a C++ switch statement so that I don't have to do it manually. 

<br/><br/>
I am passionate about programming, and am excited to learn more and do more. The worst thing that I could do is to pretend to know something that I really don't because of pride. I want to learn as much as I can, and I will ask as many questions as I can to do so. I am a lifelong student and I would not have it any other way.
