    <p>I created this game with a two other in my 2nd year of undergrad. The idea came from a project I did in the summer of 9th grade as part of UC Berkeley ATDP. That summer I took my first official programming class, though I had been doing light scripting in Game Maker before hand, this was exciting. Our large projects for the class were to create AI classes that would control an element on the screen and have it do something. The teacher had programmed the game itself but we created the AI. If you Google “Ranjith Selvan Pong” A Youtube video pop’s up of a AI match between me and a classmate.</p>

<p><br />
The other project we did in that class was a game where random pieces of food would show up on screen and we had to program an AI to get the largest score by times end. The catch was that your character would get slower as he had more food, and enemies could steal food from others by intersecting with them. Ant hill is my implementation of this game with an introduction of an “Ant hill where you can store food that can’t be stolen. Due to financial issues I had to leave the university and come back home and continue at a local university. As a result I never continued the project and has been left as is.</p>

<p><br />
It was a fun project because we decided to learn a new language, JavaScript, for it. My first introduction to a language that I really enjoy. It is very easy to prototype(JavaScript joke?) UI, and programs with JavaScript and better yet, deploy it across the web for everyone to use.</p>
