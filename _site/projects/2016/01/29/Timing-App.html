    <p>When playing games in full screen, your clock on the bottom right hand corner(on windows) is hidden. I needed to be able to tell time. I have a multi monitor setup and so I could put a clock on one of the other screens. I figured that it would be interesting to not only to keep have the current time on the screen but maybe how long I’ve been gaming, or give myself a count down for how long I can game. To satisfy this need I created an app which through google I could not find.</p>

<p><br />
It is simply a set of hidden div’s that are toggled by buttons and the div’s contain the elements needed to operate each of the functions, stopwatch, countdown, and alarm. Into making the system, I didn’t finish countdown because it felt a little redundant with alarm since the under laying math was only set up for a 24hr system, so the vestigial button remains There are also bugs in Alarm, such as not looping back around the 0:00. Again this is purely a, “From this current time on I want to time blank.”</p>
