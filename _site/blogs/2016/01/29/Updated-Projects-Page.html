    <p>I’ve added posts explaining some of the programming projects I’ve done. Most are unfinished if only because they were experiments in specific tasks. For example, I’ve started so many projects dealing with interacting circles in JavaScript it was silly to look through my file system and see so many. But they all taught me valuable programming lessons and techniques. I’ve also added links to two of my more completed projects, the Timing App, and Ant Hill.</p>
