Unity project is progressing, UI is getting close to completion. Completion is the layout and functionality. Graphics and sound effects are still needed but will be done at polish stage.

For example, I’ve started so many projects dealing with interacting circles in JavaScript it was silly to look through my file system and see so many. But they all taught me valuable programming lessons and techniques. I’ve also added links to two of my more completed projects, the Timing App, and Ant Hill.
