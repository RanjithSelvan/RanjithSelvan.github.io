I've migrated to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) sucessfully and it is pretty fantastic! I want to add a side bar to this site eventually. I also am running throught the idea of making a different page for each project and then post categories for each for them, but this may or may not happen. I might do it if I determine I will make posts are new projects I am working on and will be some what active for more than two posts. If that happens I will need to add more functionality to the website.

I was tempted to go out and get a Jekyll template and just use it since this was just a profile website but decided against it. I have time since I am currently looking for a job and add Jekyll to my resume is not a bad thing to be able to do. I am glad I learned it. It is similar to a system I used with MongoDB before so it was not too unfamilar to me.

Over all happy with the turn out. I will need to so some polish and things but we will see.
