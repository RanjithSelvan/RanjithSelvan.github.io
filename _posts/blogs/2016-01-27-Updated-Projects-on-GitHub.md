I've updated 'Sudoku' and 'Timing-App' recently as I found myself with free time and taking a break from the big Unity project. Unity project is progressing, UI is getting close to completion. Completion is the layout and functionality. Graphics and sound effects are still needed but will be done at polish stage.
