I've always wanted a website of my own to publish my personal projects and thoughts, and here is iteration one. Having recently (Dec 2015) graduated with a CS degree and in the process of looking for jobs, I needed a site I could link to and show some of my works. This is that site. NEW LAUNCH!

While looking into solutions, I did notice Jekyll as a way to control static pages for Github Pages, but that is going to take some time to look into. In the mean time, I've put up a basic site that I can update manually. That said this website is going to need more graphics to make it pop but I do like the look so far. Not bad for an afternoon of work.
